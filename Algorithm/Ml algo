Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm:-
       Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems.
       However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.
       The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that 
       we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.
          
Logistic Regression:-
      Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, which comes under the Supervised Learning technique.
      It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.
     Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable. Therefore the outcome must be a categorical or discrete value. 
     It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc. but instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1.
